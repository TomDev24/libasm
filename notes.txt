3)CPU perfoms all its calculation with registers (which are variables stored
inside CPU)
//registers 16 bit

//32 and 64 bits, using eax, rax, etc in 64bit architecture, zeroes top bytes,
8 and 16 bytes, doesnt do that

4)Data types in assembly(only int and floats of diff sizes, and additional SIMD data-type), signed and usigned int

5)MOV, LEA - pointer,  NOP - no operation
in 64 bit, memory is flat, so we store adresses in 64 bit registers

6)add sub inc dec, be careful, inc and dec doesnt set carry flag

7)Boolean

8)Shift, rotate and bit manipulation
shl - left ;;; shr - right ;; zeros out, when goes to the end // cant shift 64
